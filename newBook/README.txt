Hello,

1. To run the project make sure you are in the newBook dir i.e C:\[user dir]\newBooks\
2. Use "npm run dev" to run the server with nodemon and "npm start" to run it with node.
3. For your Database, you set your Mongodb cloud database url in the ".env" file by replacing the url in front of "DATABASE" with your own.
4. You can test with postman
5. The route for books is localhost:3000/books
6. The route for author is localhost:3000/authors

8. The route for review is localhost:3000/reviews
9. The route for signup is localhost:3000/signup

11. For the AuthorId and GenreId, first add your Author and Genre first and put their Id in their respective title in when creating Books
